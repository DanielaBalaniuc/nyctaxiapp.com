NYC Taxi Anomaly Detector


🚕 Just launched: NYC Taxi Anomaly Detector 🎉

I've built and deployed an interactive time series anomaly detection app using real-world data from NYC yellow taxis. The model is powered by an LSTM Autoencoder that identifies unusual drops or spikes in passenger activity—often linked to holidays, extreme weather, or special events.

🔍 Features:

Real-time anomaly detection from hourly data

Adjustable threshold + calendar filters

Event/holiday markers (New Year’s, MLK Day, and more)

CSV export and download

Built with: Streamlit + TensorFlow + Matplotlib

Would love feedback, stars ⭐, and thoughts on next steps—maybe integrating weather data or deploying it with real-time APIs?
